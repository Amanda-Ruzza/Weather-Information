# Weather-Information

This is a Python Script that provides weather information using data from an API generated by OpenWeatherMap.Org - used the 'Zip Code' version of this API.


Used the following Python packages:
- os [to get environment variables]
- requests [to make HTTP requests]
- sys [to have a 'clean exit' in case there is an error]
